# Notes Buddy
Welcome to Notes Buddy, a notes app made in HTML, CSS, and JS for HackClub Arcade. I made this project for HackClub Arcade as a way to enhance my JavaScript and web design skills while exploring the use of local storage for persistent data.

Through this project I was able to refine my JS skills and design skills and work on using stuff like local storage in JavaScript.

### Features:

* Add, Edit, and Delete Notes: Create, update, or remove notes easily.
* Dark Mode Toggle: Switch between light and dark modes with a smooth transition.
* Search Functionality: Quickly find notes by typing in the search bar.
* Persistent Storage: Notes are saved in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.


### How to use Notes Buddy:
1) Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/ishan211/notes-buddy.git```
2) Open the .html file in your browser
3) Toggle Dark Mode on or off to change the aesthetic of the app

5) Once you have added multiple notes, you can search between the different notes by entering a search in the top search field labelled "Search your notes...". Note: searching searches both the title and body of your notes
